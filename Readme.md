# API for diamond price prediction

## Description

API uses pretrained model (Random forest regressor) from scikit-learn package,
for diamond price prediction. Model was trained diamond_prices dataset
from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/diamonds-prices).  
Test .json file is inside ```PredictionsModelAPI/ml/Data/``` directory.

## How to use API

1. Clone this repository
    ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HomelessGodYato/Machine-Learning-REST-API.git
   ```
2. Install requirements
    ```sh
    pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Compose docker containers
    1. Compose database container:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up db
